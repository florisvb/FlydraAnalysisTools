This folder contains a complete example taking a raw h5 file and spitting out complete plots with a single script, while saving intermediate data structures along the way for making changes faster.

With Flydra and FlydraAnalysisTools installed, run the following command from inside the analysis_template directory:

>> python ./analyze.py --path='../data_directory' --h5='../DATA20120801_182653.h5'
